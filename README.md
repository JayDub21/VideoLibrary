# [Summary](https://placehold.it/15/1589F0/000000?text=+)

This application will allow for the creation of a video library to house the class recordings for the web developer bootcamp.  The admin (creator) will submit video links, video titles, and a few keywords of the key concepts that were discussed in that day’s recording.  The non-admin user (student) will access the videos and will have the ability to post comments on the individual recording pages with questions, comments or helpful links on the subject matter.  For an API, we are considering displaying Udemy courses or even just Google search results based on the keywords that are specific to each video.
